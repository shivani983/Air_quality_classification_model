Air Quality Classification Model

Overview

This project is an Air Quality Classification Model built using Machine Learning. It provides a Streamlit-based UI where users can select an ML model and input data for air quality prediction. The app loads multiple trained models from .pkl files using joblib.

Features

✅ Multiple ML models available (SVC, Logistic Regression, etc.)
✅ User-friendly UI using Streamlit
✅ Model selection for prediction
✅ Pre-trained models loaded via joblib
✅ Supports binary and multi-class classification

Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv env

Activate Virtual Environment:

Windows: env\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux: source env/bin/activate

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py

Usage

Open the Streamlit UI in your browser.

Select an ML model from the dropdown.

Enter data for air quality classification.

Click "Predict" to get results.

Dependencies

streamlit

pandas

scikit-learn

joblib

numpy

Saving and Loading Models

Saving models:

import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')

Loading models:

model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
prediction = model.predict(data)

Troubleshooting

🔹 Issue: NameError: name 'svc_binary' is not defined
✅ Fix: Ensure models are loaded using joblib.load('svc_binary.pkl') before calling them.

🔹 Issue: FileNotFoundError: Model file not found
✅ Fix: Check if .pkl files exist in the models/ directory.
